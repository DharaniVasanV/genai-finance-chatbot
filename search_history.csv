what is mutual fund,"A mutual fund is a type of financial vehicle that pools money from multiple investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. The fund is managed by professional fund managers who make investment decisions on behalf of the investors. The value of an investor's shares in the fund is determined by the net asset value (NAV) of the fund, which is calculated by dividing the total value of the fund's assets by the number of outstanding shares. Mutual funds offer investors the benefits of diversification, professional management, and potentially lower costs compared to individually investing in securities.
